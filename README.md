# Alaska-Voter
The purpose of this project is to make working with voter data easer and more efficient. I personally get at least a few requests for help every year.  Manually loading and cleaning the voter roles is a pain.

# Techninology
- Database 
  - SSDT
  - SQL 2017+
- DataAcess Layer 
  - EF6(?) 
    Currently planning to use EF6
    Why? The (very nice) EF Reverse POCO Generator (Simon Hughes) still doesn't support EF core. 
- Admin App - Probably just a tool for importing data.  This may actually be just a glorified "open-file" dialog. 
  - Probably a WinForms (easy) 
  - Not using EF6 code for this.  Not worth trouble.  It looks like it won't actually do much data access. (Just a call to a proc to import voter data)
- Web Application:
  - Would allow self service and would scale to more people.  The major parties have their own databases.  Buiness can afford to buy lists.  Many folks can't afford good data.
  - MVC?
